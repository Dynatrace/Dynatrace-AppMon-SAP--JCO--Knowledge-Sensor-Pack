You can confirm successful import by observing the "Spring Sensor" Sensor Pack in the Sensor Packs Panel. This Knowlege Sensor Pack is now _Placed_ and _Active_ within all System Profiles on this

Note:

There is no visibility into the internals of ABAP calls, however by monitoring the JCO calls, the cost of calls from Java into ABAP can be measured and provide visibility into which ABAP calls are
potentially causing problems.

Note: This Knowledge Sensor Pack has been updated to handle SAP JCO v2.1.7. This involved adding support for the class com.sap.mw.jco.JCO$Client. Prior, the only class which was covered was
com.sap.mw.jco.Client. Same methods are used on both classes.
